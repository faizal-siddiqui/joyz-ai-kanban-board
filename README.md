# Dynamic Kanban Board

## Overview

This is a small modular Kanban board implementation that meets the assignment requirements:

- Create tasks via a form
- Three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
- Drag & drop tasks between columns
- Persistence via localStorage
- Modular code split into `storage.js`, `dragDrop.js`, `render.js`, and `app.js`

## How to run

1. Place files in a folder (see file tree in the project header)
2. Serve with any static server (or open `index.html` in the browser)
